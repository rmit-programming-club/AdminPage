## Upcoming Projects
- Podcasting (Currently reaching out to academics to get this to happen)
- Competitive Programming (Our members really like this, I have traditionally thought this to be under Ali's responsibility to get the word out and to organise these events, but I'll make sure that it happens)
- Screeps (Hoping to get another person to help with planning. But it might be a bit difficult, so I might get myself onto that planning)
