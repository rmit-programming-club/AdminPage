# Podcasts
Podcasts are an attempt to create audio content for students during COVID-19.

The expression of interest form is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1h-prnx-BgPf_7FHcwRea3ktqTJK7leu3NoY7b3vDQqg/edit?usp=drive_web)

The podcasts do not have a set starting date, and we are still working out how
it will be structured and who will be speaking.

The topic of the podcasts is about what technoligies are likely to come up in
the future, and therefore what students will need to learn. For instance, Blockchain,
AI, Big Data, as well as industry practices.

## Themes of the Podcast
The themes of the podcast will include looking into the future, and making the
future seem very interesting and very worthwhile looking into. It will always
be very practical in helping people learn more about these fields.

It will also remain energetic, humourous and engaging.

## Structure of Podcasts
The podcasts will go for about 30 minutes each. The host will be Sam Nolan.
The hosts will interview and talk to industry members about the topic.

The podcast input audio will be recorded on the hosts computers using Audacity, their output audio will also be recorded on a seperate file.

The communication will take place on Microsoft Teams, over a call.

Each podcast will look into a particular subtopic, and interview 1 to 2 people
in talking about these particular topics.

Each podcast will also allow people to listen in to the event but not speak. This
audience will be allowed to type questions that can be given to both the hosts
and the speakers. These questions can then be selected by the hosts as a topic
to discuss.

The questions that will be given to the speakers will be given to the speakers
beforehand, so that they can adequately prepare and also discuss what type of
questions should be asked.

## Publishing and editing
Sam Nolan will be primarily responsible for the delivery of these podcasts, but
he will allocate if he needs help.

The audio streams will be collected and laced together, preferably using the original
audio rather than what comes through Microsoft Teams.

The podcast will then be hosted on the Programming Club page in an RSS feed.
